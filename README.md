- ðŸ‘‹ Hello there,
- You can simply refer to me as Thilini, I am a graduate in BSc Computer Science and Software Engineering.
- I find coding to be a puzzle like experience, complicated and confusing but with time and patience I am able to get the task done.
- I am no huge expert in coding myself, referring to a bunch of Youtube tutorials and courses is how I have gotten by and learned even the basics.
- To be fair, nor did school or university helped me learn about coding projects, it was mostly my self-studies that got me into programming.
- I am more of a HTML/CSS and PHP lunatic, I'm no expert, but is really interested in learning more.
- Even if I am handed over a project that is complicated, I will still find ways to complete it upto client expectations and deliver it on time.

- Yep, Thats all about me for now, if ya'll need to contact me feel free to send a mail to kavindyathiliniwd@gmail.com (long gmail?, I know, can't help it. XD)
